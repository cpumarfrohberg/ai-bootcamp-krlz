    "Summary creation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 1 - Exploration (3-5 broad searches):\n",
    "   - Start with a broad query about capybara to understand the overall topic\n",
    "   - Identify major themes and sections (e.g., taxonomy, habitat, behavior, diet, reproduction, conservation)\n",
    "   - Use general searches to map out the content structure\n",
    "   \n",
    "Phase 2 - Deep retrieval (8-12 specific searches):\n",
    "   - For each major topic identified in phase 1, perform 1-2 focused searches with specific queries\n",
    "   - Examples: \"capybara habitat South America\", \"capybara diet grasses\", \"capybara reproduction mating\"\n",
    "   - Retrieve chunks covering different aspects of each topic\n",
    "   - Total goal: ~11-17 searches overall\n",
    "   \n",
    "Phase 3 - Synthesis:\n",
    "   - Combine information from multiple search results\n",
    "   - Organize into logical sections\n",
    "   - Create a coherent, informative summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Final deliverable:\n",
    "\n",

    "Search queries:\n",
    "   - Use specific, targeted queries (e.g., \"capybara habitat\", \"capybara diet\", \"capybara behavior\")\n",
    "   - Focus on retrieving chunks that cover different aspects of the article\n",
    "   - Each search should help build a comprehensive understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary structure:\n",
    "   - Structure: Create an Article object with introduction, sections, and conclusion\n",
    "   - Introduction: A single string containing 2-3 paragraphs (4-6 sentences each) providing context\n",
    "   - Main sections (8-12 topics): taxonomy, physical description, habitat, behavior, diet, reproduction, conservation, etc.\n",
    "     - Each section has: title (string) and paragraphs (list of 2-4 paragraph strings)\n",
    "     - Each paragraph should be 4-6 sentences\n",
    "   - Conclusion: A single string containing 2-3 paragraphs synthesizing key points\n",
    "\n",
    "Content quality:\n",
    "   - All information must be based on retrieved chunks from the indexed document\n",
    "   - Reference the source chunks that support each claim\n",
    "   - Do not fabricate information\n",
    "   - Maintain accuracy and coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure and flow:\n",
    "   - Sections should progress logically (intro → taxonomy → description → behavior → etc.)\n",
    "   - Use clear transitions between sections\n",
    "   - Maintain a natural narrative flow\n",

      "introduction='The capybara (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) is the largest living rodent, native to South America, and belongs to the genus _Hydrochoerus_. These semi-aquatic mammals are closely related to guinea pigs and rock cavies, and they share a broader connection with species like the agouti and the nutria. Recognized for their sociable nature, capybaras typically inhabit savannas and dense forests, often in proximity to water bodies, where they are commonly found in groups that can range in size from a few individuals to larger gatherings of up to a hundred. Popularly referred to as the \"giant capybara,\" they play significant ecological roles in their habitats and are also of interest in human interaction and culture.' sections=[ArticleSection(title='Taxonomy and Classification', paragraphs=['Capybaras belong to the kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Rodentia, family Caviidae, and the genus _Hydrochoerus_. There are only two recognized living species in the genus: the capybara (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) and the lesser capybara (_Hydrochoerus isabelae_). Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown a close relationship between _Hydrochoerus_ and _Kerodon_, leading to classifications within the subfamily Hydrochoerinae of the family Caviidae. Their evolutionary lineage suggests that they share a common ancestor with other rodents, and various extinct relatives contribute to their fossil classification, which is still a subject of ongoing research.']), ArticleSection(title='Physical Description', paragraphs=['Capybaras have a unique physical makeup characterized by a heavy, barrel-shaped body and a short head. Adult capybaras can weigh between 50 to 91 kg, with some exceptional individuals reported to be heavier. Their fur is coarse and typically reddish-brown on the upper parts, fading to a lighter shade underneath. They possess slightly webbed feet, which aids in swimming, and their limbs are adapted for semiaquatic lifestyles. Capybaras have blunt muzzles, and their eyes and nostrils are positioned high on their heads, allowing them to see and breathe while mostly submerged in water.']), ArticleSection(title='Habitat and Distribution', paragraphs=['Capybaras are found across South America in habitats such as savannas, dense forests, and near bodies of water including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. They thrive in environments with abundant aquatic vegetation, and their ability to swim makes them well adapted to these habitats. Their range excludes Chile but extends to a vast array of ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to floodplains. Urbanization has also seen capybaras adapt to suburban areas, often found in parks and gardens near water sources.']), ArticleSection(title='Behavior', paragraphs=['Capybaras are social animals living in groups usually comprised of 10 to 20 individuals, but they can form larger groups during dry seasons when they congregate around dwindling water sources. They employ various vocalizations including barks, chirps, and whistles for communication, especially during mating or to warn of predators. Their social structure typically features one or a few dominant males overseeing a harem of females, with complex interactions separating them.']), ArticleSection(title='Diet', paragraphs=['As herbivores, capybaras primarily feed on grasses and aquatic plants, displaying selectivity in their diet based on seasonal food availability. Their feeding behavior includes eating their own feces, a process known as autocoprophagy, to re-digest food and extract nutrients more efficiently. They consume a mix of grass and other plant materials, such as fruits and tree bark, adapting their diet based on the seasons and habitat availability.']), ArticleSection(title='Reproduction', paragraphs=['Capybaras breed primarily in water, with mating season occurring during the wet season. Female capybaras signal their readiness to mate through altered scents, attracting males in the vicinity. Gestation lasts approximately 130 to 150 days, resulting in litters typically comprising four pups. The mother is primarily responsible for caring for the young, although social structures within groups may facilitate collective care.']), ArticleSection(title='Conservation Status', paragraphs=['Currently, capybaras are classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, reflecting their stable populations across most of South America. However, localized hunting for meat and pelts, as well as habitat destruction due to urban development, poses challenges to certain populations. In some regions, agricultural practices have also led to conflicts with farmers, who may view capybaras as competitors for livestock grazing.']), ArticleSection(title='Human Interactions', paragraphs=['Capybaras have become symbols in various cultural contexts, appreciated for their docile nature and friendly disposition. In certain regions, they are domesticated and kept as pets or attractions in cafés where humans can interact with them. They have also gained fame in social media and popular culture, often depicted in memes or as characters in animations, highlighting their appeal beyond their natural habitats.']), ArticleSection(title='Cultural Significance', paragraphs=['In South America, particularly in countries like Venezuela, capybara meat is consumed during Lent due to cultural traditions surrounding permissible diets during this season. Capybaras have also found their way into Japanese popular culture, celebrated in zoos and media. Izu Shaboten Zoo, for example, has even organized hot spring baths for these creatures, showcasing their popularity and the affection humans hold for them.'])] conclusion='The capybara is not only the largest rodent but also an extraordinary example of adaptation and social behavior in the wild. With their varied habitats across South America, their role in ecosystems, and their charming nature, capybaras have earned a unique status in both ecological and cultural paradigms. Efforts to ensure their conservation continue to be important, as human interactions with this species evolve alongside a changing environment, further intertwining their story with that of humanity.'\n"

      "Article(introduction=\"The capybara (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) is the world's largest rodent, native to South America. Known for its social nature, the capybara inhabits a variety of ecosystems including savannas, forests, and wetlands, often found in groups near water sources. While not currently classified as threatened, various pressures exist that affect their populations, including hunting and habitat destruction.\", sections=[ArticleSection(title='Taxonomy', paragraphs=['The capybara belongs to the family Caviidae, which includes other rodents such as guinea pigs. It is a member of the genus _Hydrochoerus_ and its species name is _H. hydrochaeris_. Capybaras are closely related to rock cavies and more distantly related to chinchillas and agoutis, illustrating their position in the rodent evolutionary tree.', \"The lineage of capybaras extends back to the Neogene period, with several fossil species discovered that indicate their long evolutionary history. The classification of extinct relatives has been reviewed and modified over the years, leading to a better understanding of their ancestral lineage. The capybara's robust body and unique adaptations to aquatic life make it a fascinating subject of study in evolutionary biology.\"]), ArticleSection(title='Physical Description', paragraphs=['Capybaras have a stout, barrel-shaped body covered in coarse brownish fur. They possess a broad, flat head, a short muzzle, and large, rounded ears. Their physical structure is designed for semi-aquatic life, allowing them to swim effectively and remain submerged for extended periods to evade predators.', 'Adult capybaras can weigh between 77 and 146 pounds (35 to 66 kg), making them the largest rodent species. They have short legs and webbed feet, facilitating their movement in water and on land. The anatomy of the capybara, including continuously growing teeth, indicates their herbivorous diet primarily consisting of grasses and aquatic plants.']), ArticleSection(title='Habitat', paragraphs=['Capybaras occupy a range of habitats across South America, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and grasslands near waterways. They thrive in environments that offer abundant vegetation and proximity to water, which is crucial for hydration and thermoregulation.', 'The adaptability of capybaras to various ecological conditions helps maintain stable populations. However, they are increasingly found in human-altered landscapes, such as farms and parks, where they often come into conflict with agricultural practices.']), ArticleSection(title='Behavior', paragraphs=['Capybaras are social animals that live in groups ranging from 10 to 20 individuals, although larger groups can be observed. Social structure within these groups includes complex hierarchies, and they engage in various forms of communication, using barks, whistles, and purrs to convey different messages.', 'These rodents are active during the day, with peak activity in the early morning and late afternoon. They often enjoy wallowing in mud or water to cool off and protect their skin from sunburn and parasites. This behavior not only helps regulate their body temperature but also plays a role in social interactions among group members.']), ArticleSection(title='Diet', paragraphs=['Capybaras are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses, aquatic plants, and some fruits. Their digestive system is adapted to process large amounts of plant material, including grasses high in cellulose, which they break down with the help of gut bacteria.', 'Interestingly, capybaras practice coprophagy, consuming their feces to maximize nutrient absorption, particularly for proteins and vitamins. This behavior is common among many herbivorous mammals, illustrating their adaptability to their natural diet.']), ArticleSection(title='Reproduction', paragraphs=['Capybaras breed year-round in areas where food is abundant, typically producing one litter per year, consisting of four to five pups on average. The gestation period lasts approximately 150 days, and the young are precocial, meaning they are relatively mature and mobile shortly after birth.', 'Mature females tend to exhibit nest-building behaviors before giving birth, ensuring their young are protected in the open environment. After birth, the pups are cared for collectively by the group, which enhances their chances of survival against predators.']), ArticleSection(title='Conservation', paragraphs=[\"Currently, capybaras are classified as 'Least Concern' by the IUCN due to stable populations in many regions of their natural habitat. However, their numbers in certain areas are threatened by hunting for meat and pelts, and they face habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and urban development.\", 'Hunting pressures have led to localized declines, especially where they are seen as competitors for livestock resources. Additionally, conflicts can occur with humans, particularly in areas where capybaras venture into urban settings or newly developed land for agricultural purposes.']), ArticleSection(title='Threats to Population', paragraphs=['Capybara populations face threats primarily from hunting and habitat destruction. In some countries, they are hunted for their meat, which is sometimes consumed as a delicacy during specific times of the year, such as Lent in Venezuela.', 'Furthermore, habitat loss due to farming, urban development, and pollution significantly reduces available living spaces for capybaras, making it harder for them to find adequate food and water sources. Competition with domestic livestock for grazing lands can also displace capybaras, leading to decreased population densities in affected areas.']), ArticleSection(title='Human Interaction', paragraphs=['Capybaras have adapted to certain human-inhabited areas, leading to a unique relationship where they are sometimes seen as pests due to their grazing habits. This has resulted in culling in regions where they are regarded as competition for agricultural resources.', 'Despite these issues, they are also popular in zoos and wildlife parks, where they attract visitors due to their docile nature. Interactions with humans when properly managed can promote conservation awareness and encourage protective efforts for their natural habitats.']), ArticleSection(title='Conclusion', paragraphs=['The capybara is a notable example of adaptability in the rodent family, exhibiting remarkable social behaviors and efficient foraging strategies. While currently classified as not threatened, continued monitoring and conservation efforts are necessary to address emerging threats to their populations.', 'Preserving natural habitats and managing human-wildlife conflicts are vital for ensuring that capybara populations remain stable. Protecting these large rodents not only maintains ecological balance but also enriches biodiversity in their native regions.'])], conclusion='In summary, the capybara is an important species that exemplifies the complex interactions between wildlife and human activity. Understanding their behavior, diet, and current challenges will be crucial for conservation efforts moving forward. Public awareness and responsible wildlife management are key to ensuring that capybaras continue to thrive in their natural habitats.')\n"
