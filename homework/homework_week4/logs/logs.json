It is a member of the genus ''[[Hydrochoerus]]''. Its close relatives include\n[[Cavia|guinea pig]]s and [[Kerodon|rock cavies]], and it is more distantly related to the [[agouti]], the [[chinchilla]], and the [[nutria]].

It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as one hundred individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals.

They are found across South America in open areas from moist [[savanna]] to [[thorn forest]]s or [[scrubland|scrub]] [[desert]]. This family of rodents has fewer members than most [[Rodent#Standard classification|other rodent families]], with 19 species in seven genera in three subfamilies.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Cavy (1).jpg|thumb|left|Guinea pig skull on top of a capybara skull]] \nWith the exception of the [[Mara (mammal)|mara]]s, which have a more [[rabbit]]-like appearance, caviids have short, heavy bodies and large heads. Most have no visible [[tail]]s. They range in size from the smaller cavies at 22&nbsp;cm in body length, and 300&nbsp;grams in weight, up to the [[capybara]], the largest of all rodents at 106 to 134&nbsp;cm in length, and body weights of 35 to 66 kilograms. Even larger forms existed in the [[Pliocene]], such as ''[[Phugatherium]]'', which was about the size of a [[tapir]].<ref name=MamEv>{{cite book |author1=Savage, RJG |author2=Long, MR |year=1986 |title= Mammal Evolution: an illustrated guide|url=https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni0000sava |url-access=registration |publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= [https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni0000sava/page/125 125–126]|isbn= 0-8160-1194-X}}</ref>\n\nThey are [[herbivore]]s, eating tough grasses or softer leaves, depending on species. The [[dentition|dental formula]] is similar to that of various other rodents: {{DentalFormula|upper=1.0.1.3|lower=1.0.1.3}}. Females give birth to two or three furred and active young after a [[gestation]] period of 50 to 90 days in most species, or 150 days in the capybara. In most species, they are sexually mature within a few months of birth, although in capybaras, maturity is not reached until around 18 months.<ref name=EoM/>\n\nSocial organisation varies widely among the group. Many cavies are promiscuous, forming no long-lasting social groups, although, in some species, males maintain harems of two or more females. In contrast, maras are [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]], and form temporary colonial [[Crèche (zoology)|crèches]] to care for the young of multiple mothers. Capybaras live in groups of around 10 individuals, and sometimes many more, each with a single dominant male, and a number of females, subordinate males, and juveniles.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D. |author1=Herrera, E. |author2=Lacher, T.E. |author3=Macdonald, D. |author4=Taber, A.B. |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/690 690–699] |isbn=0-87196-871-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/690 }}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n{{further|List of caviids}}\n\nThe family Caviidae is a sister group to the family [[Dasyproctidae]], both of which are members of the superfamily Cavioidea.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://kit.eimb.ru/PDF/Veniaminova_07_G_en.pdf|title = Phylogeny of the order Rodentia inferred from structural analysis of short retroposon B1|last = Veniaminova|first = N.

They were first observed in Pacific river valleys in Panama as early as 1912 as a subspecies of the common capybara. However, after thorough studies on the anatomy and genealogy of them, the lesser capybara was classified as its own species some time in the 1980s.{{cn|date=February 2025}} Currently, this species has expanded its range to parts of Eastern Panama and Western Colombia and Venezuela, just west of the Andes Mountains.

You will search for relevant pages, retrieve their content, and synthesize information to provide comprehensive answers.\n\nRESEARCH PROCESS (follow this order):\n\nPhase 1 - Exploration:\n   - Start with a broad query using key terms from the question to understand the overall topic\n   - Identify major themes and related topics from the search results\n   - Use general searches to map out the content structure and identify relevant Wikipedia pages\n   - Example: If asked about \"where do capybaras live\", start with \"capybara\" to find the main page and related topics\n\nPhase 2 - Deep retrieval:\n   - For each major topic identified in phase 1, perform focused searches with specific queries\n   - Examples: \"capybara habitat\", \"capybara distribution\", \"capybara range\"\n   - Search for related pages that cover different aspects of the topic\n   - IMPORTANT: Prioritize doing more searches over retrieving more pages\n   - After each search, select only the 1-2 most relevant pages to retrieve (not all pages from search results)\n   - Use the page title exactly as returned from wikipedia_search\n   - Total goal: Retrieve 5-10 most relevant pages overall, not all pages from every search\n\nPhase 3 - Synthesis:\n   - Combine information from all retrieved Wikipedia pages\n   - Synthesize the information to answer the question comprehensively\n   - Cite the Wikipedia page titles as sources\n   - If information is not available in Wikipedia, clearly state that\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY:\n   - Use specific, targeted queries (e.g., \"capybara\", \"capybara habitat\", \"capybara distribution\")\n   - Focus on finding pages that cover different aspects of the topic\n   - Each search should help build a comprehensive understanding\n   - If a search doesn't return relevant results, try alternative search terms or synonyms\n\nPAGE RETRIEVAL:\n   - After finding relevant pages in search results, use wikipedia_get_page to get full content\n   - IMPORTANT: Retrieve only the most relevant pages (5-10 total), not all pages from every search\n   - Select the 1-2 most relevant pages per search result, not all pages\n   - Prioritize doing more searches over retrieving more pages\n   - Use the page title exactly as returned from wikipedia_search\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nCRITICAL: You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do NOT include any explanatory text before or after the JSON.\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else\n- Do NOT write \"Based on the search results...\" or any other text before the JSON\n- Do NOT include markdown code blocks (```json ... ```)\n- Start your response with {{ and end with }}\n- The JSON must contain these exact fields:\n  - \"answer\": A string response based on Wikipedia content\n  - \"confidence\": A float between 0.0 and 1.0 (0.0 to 1.0)\n  - \"sources_used\": A list of Wikipedia page titles used (e.g., [\"Capybara\", \"South America\", \"Rodent\"])\n  - \"reasoning\": Brief explanation (optional string or null)\n\nExample - return ONLY this (no text before or after):\n{{\n  \"answer\": \"Capybaras live in South America, primarily in countries like Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, and Argentina. They inhabit areas near water such as rivers, lakes, swamps, and marshes, as they are semi-aquatic animals that need water for both drinking and protection from predators.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"sources_used\": [\"Capybara\", \"South America\", \"Rodent\"],\n  \"reasoning\": \"Found relevant Wikipedia pages on capybara habitat and distribution\"\n}}\n\nIMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object. No introductory text, no explanations, no markdown formatting. Just the raw JSON.\n\n\nSEARCH REQUIREMENTS (EVALUATION MODE):\n   - Phase 1: Perform at least 3 broad searches to explore the topic\n   - Phase 2: Perform 8-12 specific searches for deep retrieval\n   - Total goal: ~11-17 searches overall to build comprehensive understanding\n   - Do NOT stop early - complete all phases to ensure thoroughness\n   - IMPORTANT: Prioritize doing more searches over retrieving more pages\n   - Retrieve only 5-10 most relevant pages total, not all pages from every search\n   - This ensures consistent, reproducible behavior for testing",
